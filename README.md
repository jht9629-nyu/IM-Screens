## Course Description

Interactive multi-screen experiences

We experience screens daily in many forms: in our hands,
on our desktops, on walls and public installations as we travel.
This course will explore the creative possibilities of real-time
interactive and reactive art on screens in various forms.
Using the recently developed p5VideoKit we will create standalone installations.
[p5VideoKit](https://github.com/jht1493/p5VideoKit) is a new library of live video effects - building on p5js -
presented as a dashboard for mixing video in the browser.
This library allows the user to apply visual effects to live video
from connected cameras and sensors or streaming from devices on the internet.
p5VideoKit is open source and can be extended with the user’s p5js code for
a plethora of visual effects and interactivity. One possible application of p5Videokit
would be a public facing installation allowing anonymous people on the street
to use their hand held devices to interact with large street facing screens,
thereby collaborating on real time creation of “digital graffiti”.

Building on ICM, students will learn how to adapt simple sketches
into components of p5VideoKit so that algorithms can be
quickly composited and orchestrated into more complex works.
Students will also learn how to edit and share code beyond the p5js editor,
use nodejs/javascript to automate deployment of installations,
and remotely configure dedicated computers with long running installations.
Several dedicated computers and screens will be available to preview installations
on the floor and street facing areas of the 370 Jay Street campus.
