# Week 4- Final Proposal 
Question, can the input of a sketch manipulate the output of another sketch. Currently, I am working with P5.LiveMedia and Posenet to try to create a multiscreen interaction. What I want is for the central to stream a live video to the peripheral and for the peripheral to use that video to manipulate a posenet estimation. The hope (for installation) is to face two monitors towards each other where the central (in front of the viewer) is displaying a webcam video, and the peripheral (behind the viewer) is reading the same webcam, and outputting what it seens as a visual. Other options include using Handpose and Teachable Machine. Or creating a feedback loop/ feedback chamber by just facing the cameras of each monitor together and manipulating the video output on each sketch.  

orrr creating and manipulating a green screen.
